# Conductor

Development and testing environment management for cyber-physical systems.

Conductor allows you to define isolated environments for the different components of your system, linking them up with well-defined connections.

## CLI

The `conductor` CLI is the main interface for using conductor.

See `conductor --help` for usage.

## Configuration

A conductor system is defined by a `conductor.toml` configuration file. See the example configuration files for each system in the [test_resources](./test_resources/systems/) directory.
